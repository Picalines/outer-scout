    OuterScout API allows you to create scene recordings of the Outer Wilds

    With this API you can put multiple cameras on your scene, create keyframes to animate their parameters and transformation, and then record color and depth information to your disk

          In the request body you define the origin point, that is parented to some Unity GameObject.
          That's required because Outer Wilds regularly "recenters the universe" to avoid floating point errors,
          so Unity global coordinates are not practical

          The scene origin is a GameObject named "scene.origin"
